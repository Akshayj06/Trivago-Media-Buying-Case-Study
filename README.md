# **Trivago Media Buying Case Study**

## **Overview**

This project aims to analyze the efficiency of TV ad spots for Trivago's media buying campaigns. By leveraging a dataset that includes advertising spots across various TV channels, this case study provides insights into how media buying decisions impact brand performance. The primary focus is on maximizing cost-efficiency and enhancing campaign success through quantitative analysis.

## **Objectives**

- **Maximize Cost-Efficiency**: Understand the effectiveness of different ad formats and channels in order to reduce costs while maximizing reach.
- **Improve Campaign Success**: Use data analysis to optimize media spend and identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that lead to better performance.

## **Data Overview**

The dataset includes details about:
- TV channels and advertising spots
- Costs associated with different spots
- Ad formats (e.g., 20", 30")
- Timing of ads (days of the week, time slots)
- Audience contacts and engagement metrics

## **Key Metrics**

1. **Cost Per Thousand Contacts (CPM)**: `(Net Euro Spend / Adjusted Contacts) * 1000`
2. **Visits Per Million Contacts (VPMC)**: `(Visits / Adjusted Contacts) * 1,000,000`
3. **Cost Per Visit (CPV)**: `Net Euro Spend / Visits`

These KPIs allow for comparing the performance of ad spots across different channels and formats.

## **Analysis Insights**

- **Ad Spot Lengths**: 
   - 20" spots are more cost-efficient (better VPMC).
   - 30" spots are effective for brand recall due to lower CPM.
- **Channel and Weekday Performance**:
   - Channels like 'Ned1' and 'RTL4' have high engagement on Mondays.
   - Cost-efficient channels like 'Erediv' and 'Eurosport' perform well for multi-day ads.
   - Weekend channels such as 'Animal' and 'Comedy' have higher viewership.

## **Recommendations**

### **For Brand Awareness Campaigns**:
- Allocate more budget to 30" spots, especially during high-viewership slots, to improve message recall and brand awareness.
  
### **For Action-Oriented Campaigns**:
- Prioritize 20" spots for better cost-efficiency in driving user engagement (higher VPMC).
- Focus on interactive or sports-related programs with higher audience engagement.

## **Impact of TV Campaigns**

- **Short-Term**: Real-time feedback allows tracking of viewer engagement through VPMC, enabling responsive adjustments to campaigns.
- **Long-Term**: Consistent messaging fosters brand recognition and loyalty.

## **Conclusion**

To optimize ad campaigns:
- Increase the allocation of spots with a high return on investment (ROI).
- Prioritize channels and time slots with the best balance of cost-efficiency and engagement.
- Continuously monitor both short-term and long-term performance to make strategic adjustments.
